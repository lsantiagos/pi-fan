# Electrically interfacing your fan to the Pi

_(This is work in progress, more info is the the way ...)_

I have interfaced my Noctua fan (40x10mm 5V fan, NF-A4x10) using one of these logic level converters ([Sparkfun BOB-12009](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009)). It translates the fan's 5V level to the Pi's 3.3V. Similar units can be bought for a song and a dance on chinese online-markets (Adafruit, Ebay, AliExpress etc. - just Google for 'logic level converter'). My reason for choosing this solution is that it is simple, more or less fool proof and I happened to have one laying around.
