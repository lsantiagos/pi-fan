# Pre-built executable binaries
This folder contain some pre-built pi-fan executables. The name of the files correspond to the date they were built against a fully updated (latest version with all updates) running instance of Raspbian.

You should check the binaries against these SHA-256 checksums before you install them on your pi.

Note: If you decide to use one of these, you should rename the executable to just *pi-fan* before installing it. The installation instructions and systemd service unit file assumes that the xecutable is called *pi-fan*.
